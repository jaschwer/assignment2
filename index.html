<p>Using parts of old assignments from latex. I first converted the assignments to .md and then used parts of them and played with it. I hope it is okay that I do not include all the latex-files I used as a source. I read this option to late.</p>

To include state effects there are several options. Firstly dummy variables (D2-D46) for each state can be added to the regression. Equivalently, a fixed effect within transformation can be applied to get rid of unobserved state-specific effects. If the state-specific effects can be argued to be uncorrelated with the included regressors, a random effects model can be estimated. In fact, the Hausmann test does no reject the RE model. Since the RE model yields very similar estimates we will stick with the FE model for comparative purposes.<br />
<br />
Given that smoking is an addiction it is plausible that there might be serial correlation, which is confirmed by a test for serial correlation in the residuals obtained from the FD regression. Given substantial serial correlation, the FD regression should generally be preferred.<br />

As argued in the paper by Baltagi &amp; Li (1999) when modelling the demand of cigarettes it is appropriate to take into account spatial correlation across states due to border effect purchases. Further, interaction between states can result in correlated outcome. Over this suggests that the error terms are correlated across states. To account for this correlation amongst states, interaction variables that reflect endogenous and exogenous interaction effects can be added to the regression.<br />
<br />
Endogenous effects suggest that the demand of a state is influenced by its neighbours’ outcomes. We are trying to capture this effect by including <span class="math inline">\(glnc\)</span>, which, for each individual state, represents the average cigarette demand of those other states it is related to as determined by the matrix <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. This effect is likely to be endogenous as there is a feedback process taking place between neighbours, since links between states should be reciprocal given the spatial weight matrix. However, only the final outcome of the feedback process will be measured and it is impossible to differentiate the causal affect of a particular state <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and vice versa. In order to make out this causal impact instrumental variables are a solution. Availability of instrumental variables is determined by the existence of intransitive triads in the network structure. As each individual state has its own group that it interacts with, it should be possible to find a state k that is related to state j but not i such that <span class="math inline">\(G_{ik}=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_{ij} \cdot G_{jk}&gt;0\)</span>. Exogenous characteristics of this state <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> can then be used as an instrument for <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and thus the causal effect of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> can be isolated.<br />
<br />
With instrumental variables, it is also possible to differentiate exogenous from endogenous effects and thus to break the reflection problem. Exogenous interaction effects refer to correlated outcomes as <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s socioeconomic characteristics impact on <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s outcome, vice versa.</p>

<p>Proxy controls partially account for OVB, which is the main reason for including them in a regression. Yet, they are simultaneously determined by the regressor of interest. This is also the case in our example where late ability is causally related to the omitted variable ability, which is meant to represent, yet it is equally a function of the regressor high school education. Including proxy controls will thus lead to biased estimates as highlighted by the equations in part a (though this bias might be an improvement over the bias present when not at all accounting for OVB). The restriction suggests that the proxy variable late ability is neither causally affected by high school education, so it is not itself an intermediate outcome, nor is it subject to a general shift which would be reflected in the constant. Instead, this assumption implies that the proxy variable late ability is purely a function of the latent variable, ability <span class="math inline">\(a_{i}\)</span>, that we are trying to capture with it. Given this assumption it is possible to identify the direct effect of completed high school education on future earnings.</p>
